# Virtual-Mail-Server-Project
In this project, I worked with a group to set up a virtual mail server that ensured secure and reliable email delivery. The process began with updating system packages and configuring DNS records to route mail for the domain. Key software components were installed to handle mail transport, authentication, and spam filtering. To keep everything organized, we created a MySQL database to manage virtual domains, users, and aliases. Postfix was also configured to query this database for routing and authentication. Lastly, SMTP authentication was implemented to ensure only authorized users could send mail through the server, strengthening security and reducing spam.
